Get Improved Bounce Rate Information

== Description ==

By default, Google Analytics counts anyone visiting a page and then not going to another page as a bounce. This can read to quite high and inaccurate bounce rate as many search engine visitors visit the page and then leave after getting information. 

This plugin fixes this problem. It generates an event for Google Analytics after the visitor has your page open for 15 seconds. This way, you get more accurate bounce rate information. To add accuracy, any administrators, editors and authors are not tracked. 

The idea for this plugin came from this post: http://drawingablank.me/blog/fix-your-bounce-rate.html

If you are having any problems with this plugin, contact me at [WordPress Blog Experts](http://wpblogexperts.com/contact-us/)

Following features will be in next version:

* Ability to decide which user roles are tracked. 
* Other options to make bounce rate more accurate (if user scrolls, if users keep your page open in active tab for x seconds).

== Installaion ==

1. Upload analytics-unbounce.php to a folder named 'analytics-unbounce' in 'wp-content/plugins' directory. 
2. Activate the plugin. 
3. Go to Settings &rarr; Analytics Unbounce and enter your Google Analytics ID.
